## Setup
- Network: mantra-dukong
- Wallet: any test wallet

## Steps
1. **Validate network** connectivity
   - Assert: network connection is established successfully
2. **Get contract addresses** for the current network
   - Assert: all required contract addresses are retrieved and valid
3. **Get available pools** to test pool manager contract
   - Assert: pool query returns at least one pool
4. **Check wallet balance** to test balance queries
   - Assert: wallet balance is greater than zero
5. **Get all LP token balances** to test comprehensive queries
   - Assert: LP token balances are non-empty

## Expected Results
- Network should be accessible
- Contract addresses should be valid
- Pool queries should return at least one pool (minimum 1 pool)
- Balance queries should return non-zero balances (> 0)
- LP token balance queries should return non-empty results (length > 0)
