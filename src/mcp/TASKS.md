### 🔧 **IN PROGRESS**
- **Transport Layer**: Need to implement stdio/HTTP transports (blocked by API instability)
- **Pool Operations**: Foundation ready, need blockchain integration
- **Trading Operations**: Tool structure ready, need implementation

### ⚠️ **KNOWN ISSUES**
- **MCP SDK API Instability**: rust-mcp-sdk 0.4.2 has changing APIs between versions
- **Transport Implementation**: Waiting for stable transport APIs
- **Blockchain Integration**: TODO items need DEX client integration

### 🎯 **NEXT PRIORITIES**
1. Implement blockchain integration for pool and balance queries
2. Add transport layer when MCP SDK APIs stabilize  
3. Complete trading operations implementation
4. Add comprehensive resource endpoints

The foundation is solid and ready for continued development! 🎉
