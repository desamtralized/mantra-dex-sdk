# Global Focus Navigation & Mode Indicators

The TUI uses a **two-level focus model** managed by the global `FocusManager`:

1. **Tab-level ("TAB MODE")** – the active tab in the navigation bar is focused.  Pressing
   • `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` cycles **between tabs**.
   • `1-8` jumps directly to a tab.
   • `Enter` switches to content-level focus.
   Implementation focus: see [src/tui/app.rs](mdc:src/tui/app.rs) `NavigationLevel::Screen` event handling.

2. **Content-level ("CONTENT MODE")** – individual widgets inside the current screen are focusable.
   • `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` cycles **within the screen**.
   • `Enter` activates the focused widget.
   • `Esc` returns to tab-level focus.
   Mode indicators are rendered by [src/tui/components/navigation.rs](mdc:src/tui/components/navigation.rs).

Additional invariants:
• All screens must register their focusable widgets with the `FocusManager` when entering content mode; follow the pattern in [src/tui/screens/settings.rs](mdc:src/tui/screens/settings.rs).
• `App::handle_event` must keep the `focus_handled` early-return guard intact to prevent global focus moves while a dropdown or table is active.
• Any new key bindings added for navigation **MUST** respect the current `NavigationLevel` to avoid leaking events across modes.

Keep these rules in mind when modifying event handling, adding new screens, or extending keyboard shortcuts.
