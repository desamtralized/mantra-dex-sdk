# MCP Compilation Rule

When compiling or checking the MCP server (or any code paths that require MCP-specific components), always include the `mcp` feature flag. 

## Allowed Commands

Use these commands for compilation validation:

```bash
cargo check --features mcp
cargo build --features mcp
cargo test --features mcp
```

## Prohibited Commands

**NEVER** use `cargo run --bin` commands for compilation validation:

```bash
# ‚ùå DO NOT USE - These can hang or cause issues
cargo run --bin mcp-server --features mcp
cargo run --bin mcp-server --features mcp -- --help
```

## Rationale

- `cargo check` and `cargo build` validate compilation without executing the binary
- `cargo run` can hang, require user interaction, or cause other runtime issues
- Compilation validation should focus on build success, not runtime behavior

This ensures that all MCP-gated modules are compiled and that feature-dependent code paths are validated during development without runtime complications.
