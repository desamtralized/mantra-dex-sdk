# Swap Screen Navigation & Token Parsing

The swap screen has custom keyboard and token-list behaviour:

1. **Arrow-key handling inside dropdown lists**
   • While either the pool dropdown or the token dropdown is focused (or currently in editing mode), `Up`/`Down` key events must stay inside the list.
   • `App::handle_event` contains an early guard that prevents forwarding `Event::MoveFocus` to the global `FocusManager` in these situations.  See [src/tui/app.rs](mdc:src/tui/app.rs) around the `focus_handled` guard.

2. **Token list derivation from pool name**
   • When a pool is selected the token dropdown is repopulated via `SwapScreenState::update_tokens_for_pool`.
   • The function finds the pool's display name in `available_pools`, strips the leading `"Pool X:"` prefix, then splits the remainder on `" / "` to get the two asset symbols.  See [src/tui/screens/swap.rs](mdc:src/tui/screens/swap.rs).

Keep these invariants in mind when modifying focus navigation or pool/token logic.
